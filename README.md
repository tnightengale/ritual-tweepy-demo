# ritual-tweepy-demo

### A project to experiment with web-scraping and the tweepy API


This project is a place to experiment with web-scraping and the tweepy API.

The current .py file is used to run a tweepy.stream with the credentials of a burner twitter account called @lunchatron9000: <https://twitter.com/lunchatron9000>

When this account receives a mention asking it where one should eat lunch, it returns a random restaurant in
the downtown of Toronto and the corresponding link to the restaurant on the food ordering platform, Ritual.

### Future uses for this project include:

* enabling restaurants to sign in with Oauth twitter credentials and automatically reply with a link to their restaurant on Ritual
* collecting tweets about restaurants on Ritual's platform for future analysis (eg. sentiment analysis or time-series analysis)
* collecting information on twitter users who interact with restaurants on Ritual
